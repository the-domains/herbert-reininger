**The Creative Director.**

A person who is curious, driven, demanding, and perhaps even a bit rebellious. A creative pioneer who empowers and values his team...inspiring innovative ideas while also delivering top-line results.

I am a design-based creative director with 20+ years experience leading global creative initiatives, producing award-winning designs, and traversing the globe collaborating with like-minded people. I seek to empower creative teams to generate not only visibility and profits---but pride. I want people to recognize and maximize their talents as together we celebrate the perfection that comes from meaningful collaboration.

Someone once described me as a "creative professional with a capital 'C'...who lives and breathes the creative process, consistently bringing positivity, openness, and a truly multicultural, global perspective to his work." Every day, I aspire to make sure those words are true.
